### Lib3man

Lib3man is a small C library I'm building for learning purposes and for use in my other C projects.

It includes some basic data structures :

- Memory arenas
- Arena-list (for managing multiple arenas)
- Length-based string (string view (sv))
- Dynamically allocated strings (string buffer (sb))

#### Goals

The goal of this library is to explore low-level C design, memory management, while keeping the code simple and easy to understand.
