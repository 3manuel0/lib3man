### lib3man

lib3man is a small C library I'm building for learning and for use in my other C projects.
It includes some basic data structures and utilities for now it has a dynamic array, a length-based-string (string view), dynamicly-allocated-strings (string buffer).
Also has my humble attempt at creating my own (mini) printf (pr3intf (with no buffering)) for learning and experimenting (would likely never use it).
