### ðŸ§ª lib3man

lib3man is a small C library I'm building for learning and for fun too. It includes some basic data structures and utilities for now it has dynamic array and a mini printf (pr3intf) more comming soon...

### ðŸŽ¯ Why I Made This

I wanted to understand how things like arrays and allocators work under the hood, without relying on the C standard library too much. Itâ€™s mostly a learning exercise â€” and maybe something I can reuse in other projects later.
